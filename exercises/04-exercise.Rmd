## Review the scenario object

Print the scenario object, what model is selected?

```{r}

```

Display the scenario parameters by changing the scenario object to a tibble.

```{r}

```


Run the simulation, then look at the results.

```{r}
my_results
```

Display the summary results.

```{r}
summarize_scenario(my_results)
```

Look at the loss scatterplot.

```{r}
loss_scatterplot(my_results)
```


Loss at the risk exposure histogram.

```{r}
exposure_histogram(my_results)
```
