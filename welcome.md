# Information for Tidyrisk Workshop

# Schedule

The course will run from 2pm to 3:30pm.

# Instructors

This workshop is taught by David Severski.

We'll also have teaching assistants in the room to help out if you get stuck or have questions.

# Recommended reading

We'll start day one with some review of foundations, but I'd recommend you at least skim the following chapters of "Advanced R" and "R for Data Science" before you come:

* Functions, <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html>
* Vectors, <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html>
* Subsetting, <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html>

If you're not already familiar with the basics of markdown, please do the 10 minute tutorial at <https://www.markdowntutorial.com>.

On the day of the course, I'll share all the slides, code and data with you via dropbox.

# R setup

The course is hands on, so you'll need a **laptop with a recent version of R**. 

In addition, run the following to get the required packages:

```r
install.packages(c("evaluator"), dependencies = TRUE)
```

Using RStudio is strongly encouraged. Please make sure you have a current
version RStudio, 1.2 is available as of April 2019. You can download from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
  
If you often work on a network drive, it is worth verifying you can load the above packages when you are not connected to the internet, just in case there are wifi problems on the day.

If you have any problems with the setup, please come a little early, and 
we'll help you get configured. The TAs and I will be around from 8am.  As a 
backup, we'll also have an [RStudio Cloud](rstudio.cloud) project set up 
with all the materials and required packages, so even if something goes 
wrong, as long as you have internet access you'll be able to follow along.

**Don't forget your power cable!**
