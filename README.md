# R Setup

The course is hands on, so you'll need a **laptop with a recent version of R**. 

In addition, run the following to get the required packages:

```r
install.packages("evaluator")
```

Using RStudio is strongly encouraged. Please make sure you have a current
version RStudio. RStudio 1.2 is the current relase as of April 2019. You 
can download from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.
  
If you often work on a network drive, it is worth verifying you can load the 
above packages when you are not connected to the internet, just in case 
there are wifi problems on the day.

If you have any problems with the setup, please come a little early and 
we'll help you get configured. The TAs and I will be around from 8 AM.  
We'll have an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) project set up as a 
backup with all the materials and required packages, so you'll be able to 
follow along even if something goes wrong, as long as you have internet access.

**Don't forget your power cable!**
